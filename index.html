        This project is focused on the ways in which 2020 may have 
        impacted the music industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
        There have been many changes to our daily lives, and many industries
        and facets of life have also had to accomodate to these changes.  In
        the case of the music industry, there has been a prominent shift in 
        virality due to livestreaming and social media services (like TikTok).  
        This is most likely due to the fact that live shows are not a possibility
        in our current environment.  Furthermore, album sales have seen a drop and
        streaming has seen a rise, which may be attributed to financial issues and
        changes that have arisen from the pandemic.  Lastly, there has been a 
        more versatile cast of artists consistently reaching the top of the charts
        and gaining more popularity.  Along with this, there has been a rise in 
        social movements throughout 2020 that seem to have some effect in popularizing
        certain songs that focus on certain themes.  Overall, this project aims
        to analyze Billboard's 2019 and 2020 End-of-Year records and make inferences
        using the compiled data from these records to substantiate these claims.
