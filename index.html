      Luis Sanchez - Data Visualization Final Project (Drafting)

    <h1 class="Title">2020 Blues</h1>
    <div class="desc">
        This project is focused on the ways in which 2020 may have 
        impacted the music industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
        There have been many changes to our daily lives, and many industries
        and facets of life have also had to accommodate to these changes.  In
        the case of the music industry, there has been a prominent shift in 
        popularity due to livestreaming and social media services (like TikTok).
        This is most likely due to the fact that live shows are not a possibility
        in our current environment.  Furthermore, album sales have seen a drop and
        streaming has seen a rise, which may be attributed to financial issues and
        changes that have arisen from the pandemic.  Lastly, there has been a 
        more versatile cast of artists consistently reaching the top of the charts
        and gaining more popularity.  Along with this, there has been a rise in 
        social movements throughout 2020 that seem to have some effect in popularizing
        certain songs that focus on certain themes.  Overall, this project aims
        to analyze Billboard's 2019 and 2020 End-of-Year records and make inferences
        using the compiled data from these records to substantiate these claims.

            <li class="mainBullets"><b>Overview:</b> I'm focusing on music industry trends for this project.  I will be
                tracking any changes from 2019 to 2020 that I can find from the corresponding
                Billboard end-of-year records.</li>
            <li class="mainBullets"><b>Completed Features (Not Including Interaction):</b>
                <ul class="indent">
                    <li><b>Bar Graph Group 1:</b> This group of bar graphs is meant to represent
                    sales/streaming trends between 2019 and 2020.  I'm looking to add a
                    couple more diverging graphs and maybe add an option button that lets
                    the user pick bar graphs that have different data for the bigger (main)
                    bar graph.</li>
                    <li><b>Growing Bubble Race:</b> This visualization represents the top 5
                    songs that experienced the most increase in daily audio streams from the week
                    of (May 22nd - May27th) to (May 28th - June 6th).  This is a notable time frame
                    because George Floyd's death occurred on May 25th.  With this and other visualizations
                    that I am still looking into, I want to see how social movements and events can and
                    have impacted the music industry, as 2020 was a very tumultuous year.</li>

            <li class="mainBullets">
                <b>Upcoming Milestones:</b> I want to move on to the other visualizations I have planned for
                my other two sections, but I also have many plans for user interaction (i.e. mouseover events,
                tooltips, etc.)  I will also add some analysis paragraphs and highlight some trends that may be
                seen from the visualizations.  For the visualizations that require more background - such as the
                Growing Bubble Race - I will also add an intro paragraph that describes what it is meant to
                show.  I will also add citations that specify the pages where I gathered my data.
